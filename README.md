# Currency Converter
This is an personal project of CS426 - Mobile Device Application Development ([University of Science](https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/)).
The project can behave as a calculator or a currency converter at the same time. 
The application retrieves exchange rates from [Foreign exchange rates API
with currency conversion](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). It can also record history after a conversion.
